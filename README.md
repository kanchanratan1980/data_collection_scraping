# data_collection_scraping
This project involves web scraping, data analysis, and visualization of Mars-related data using Python. It is divided into two parts:

Part 1: Mars News Scraping

Scrapes the latest Mars news headlines and summaries from a webpage.
Uses automated browsing (Splinter) and HTML parsing (BeautifulSoup) to extract content.
Stores the data in a structured format for further use.
Part 2: Mars Weather Data Analysis

Scrapes a Mars weather dataset containing temperature, pressure, and seasonal data.
Cleans, processes, and analyzes the data using Pandas.
Uses visualizations (Matplotlib) to identify weather trends and estimate the length of a Martian year.
Saves the cleaned dataset to a CSV file.
